Changes in Sprint 1:
---------------------------------

GUI
1. Defined and created variables and objects of bus, station, line, board, neighborhood.
2. Created a draft of the city's neighborhoods and stations (can be shown by running Board.java)

Spectra
1. Defined and created variables of bus, station, line,
2. Added counters for the number of stations each bus stopped at (needed in order to know when to go to the gas station).
3. Added counters for the number of stations each bus skipped (needed in order to know if an extra bus should be assigned to this line).
4. Added guarantees for each line, in order to send an extra bus when needed.


Changes from Sprint 1 to Sprint 2:
---------------------------------

1. Decreased the size of the problem in order to decrease the synthesization time.
2. Made the spectra realizable
3. Synthesized a controller for BusBossMain
4. Added guarantees
5. Added assumptions

Changes from Sprint 2 to Sprint 3:
---------------------------------
1. Decreased the size of the problem in order to fix the corrupted controller.
2. Added guarantees
3. Added assumptions
4. Fixed iff gar's in specificiation
5. Added buttons to different scenarios
6. GUI now interacts with the controller: busses move according to their line/ to gas station

Delivered in Final Submission
---------------------------------
- Java:
    1. Add directions to the picture of the bus (for each road coordiante)
    2. Visualize the raining scenario (with clouds or something similar)
    3. Improve visualization of main station and gas station
    3. Bug in the route when arriving back to main station
    4. Randomize the boolean for people in station with higher probability when rushHour scenario in on
    5. Change the probabilities of the randomized env variables to something more realistic (for example, bus should not become full so quickly)
    6. Check the visualization when extra busses are sent
    7. Visualize when bus is full
    8. Visualize when a line needs an extra bus

- Spectra:
    1. Add gar's for the rain and rush scenario
