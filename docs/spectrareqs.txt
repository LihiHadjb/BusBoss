Guarantees:
-----------
- Add initial guarantees
    - Guarantee for each bus: at the beginning, the bus is at main station and shouldn't go to gas station.
    - Guarantee for each bus: at the beginning, reserve busses are not in use and other busses are in use.
- Guarantee for each bus: while a the bus is on it's way to the gas station (meaning shouldGoToGasStation = true), it shouldn't stop (meaning next(shouldStop) = false),
- Guarantee for each bus: it will stop if there are people waiting or if stop button was pressed (unless it needs to go to the gas station)
- Guarantee for each bus: while it's not raining and no passenger pressed on the STOP button - if no passengers waiting at the next station OR the bus is full, the bus shouldn't stop.
- Counters for each bus: counts the number of rounds the bus has passed in order to know when it should go to the gas station
- Guarantee for each bus: numOfStopsPassedBus = MAX_STATIONS_TO_GAS_STATION <--> then the bus shouldGoToGasStation
- A counter for each line: counts the number of stations where passengers were waiting for the bus (of the particular line) but it was full and couldn't pick them up
  If an extra bus is sent to help to the particular line, the counter resets
- A monitor for each line: monitors whether the counter of the line has reached to MAX_UNSTOPPED_STATIONS and no extra bus was sent,
  in order to keep the waitingA flag on and signal that an extra bus is needed
- Guarantee for each line: eventually, every line will not need an extra bus - that is in order to promise that each line will get an extra bus when needed
- If both lines received an extra bus for help, then the two reserve busses were available at the step before
- If only line A received an extra bus for help, then the at least one reserve bus was available at the step before
- If only line B received an extra bus for help, then the at least one reserve bus was available at the step before
- If an extra bus was sent to help a particular line, then this line was waiting for extra bus at the step before
- If both lines received an extra bus for help, each reserve bus was sent to help different line
- If only line A received an extra bus for help and only the first reserve bus was available, then the first reserve bus was sent to help line A
- If only line A received an extra bus for help and only the second reserve bus was available, then the second reserve bus was sent to help line A
- If only line A received an extra bus for help and both reserve busses were available, then one of them was sent to help line A
- If only line B received an extra bus for help and only the first reserve bus was available, then the first reserve bus was sent to help line B
- If only line B received an extra bus for help and only the second reserve bus was available, then the second reserve bus was sent to help line B
- If only line B received an extra bus for help and both reserve busses were available, then one of them was sent to help line B
- As long as the bus is in use (i.e. not parking) and in the middle of a round (i.e. not in main station which represents finishing a full round), don't change the bus's line
- If it is raining, every bus should stop at every station, except busses that are on their way to the gas station.


Assumptions:
-----------
- Add initial assumptions:
    - Each bus is initially:
        not full, not at destination station, not at gas station, passengers are not waiting at its next station.
    - Each bus is initially:
        parking (meaning, initially not in use).
- Each bus should be at destination station an infinite number of times.
- Each reserve bus should park an infinite number of times.
