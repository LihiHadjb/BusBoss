Project Tasks
-------------

- Java:
    1. Add directions to the picture of the bus (for each road coordiante)
    2. Visualize the raining scenario (with clouds or something similar)
    3. Improve visualization of main station and gas station
    3. Bug in the route when arriving back to main station
    4. Randomize the boolean for people in station with higher probability when rushHour scenario in on
    5. Check the visualization when extra busses are sent
    6. Visualize when bus is full
    7. Visualize when a line needs an extra bus

- Spectra:
    1. Add gar's for the rain and rush scenario






Delivered in Sprint 1
---------------------

GUI
1. Defined and created variables and objects of bus, station, line, board, neighborhood.
2. Created a draft of the city's neighborhoods and stations (can be shown by running Board.java)

Spectra
1. Defined and created variables of bus, station, line,
2. Added counters for the number of stations each bus stopped at (needed in order to know when to go to the gas station).
3. Added counters for the number of stations each bus skipped (needed in order to know if an extra bus should be assigned to this line).
4. Added guarantees for each line, in order to send an extra bus when needed.



Delivered in Sprint 2
---------------------

1. Decreased the size of the problem in order to decrease the synthesization time.
2. Made the spectra realizable
3. Synthesized a controller for BusBossMain
4. Added guarantees
5. Added assumptions


Delivered in Sprint 3
---------------------
Spectra
1. Decreased the size of the problem in order to fix the corrupted controller.
2. Added guarantees
3. Added assumptions
4. Fixed iff gar's in specificiation

GUI

- In each step each bus should update it's origin station and destination station.
- Change the GUI to match the new size of the problem.
- Add initialize guarantees for the busses (all busses first origin station should be the main station, reserve busses should not be in use, etc.)
- Add roads between neighborhood, gas station and main station.
- Create the routes for the busses, and make the busses drive on them.
- Find pictures for the objects (bus, gas station, people, bus stationsï¿½).
- Make the unused busses visible in the central station
- Separeted the city logic from the painting logic and controller logic (code is now separeted to packages).
- Added buttons to different scenarios
- GUI now interacts with the controller: busses move according to their line/ to gas station
