Project Tasks
-------------

- GUI: 
    - Init city in the run() method and move all the draw methods into the respective classes, so that each object will draw itself.
    - Add roads between neighborhood, gas station and main station.
	- Create the routes for the busses, and make the busses drive on them.
	- Find pictures for the objects (bus, gas station, people, bus stations…).
	- Make the unused busses visible in the central station
- In each step each bus should update it's origin station and destination station.
- Change the GUI to match the new size of the problem.
- Add initialize guarantees for the busses (all busses first origin station should be the main station, reserve busses should not be in use, etc.)
- Add guarantees
- Add assumptions



Delivered in Sprint 1
---------------------

GUI
1. Defined and created variables and objects of bus, station, line, board, neighborhood.
2. Created a draft of the city's neighborhoods and stations (can be shown by running Board.java)

Spectra
1. Defined and created variables of bus, station, line,
2. Added counters for the number of stations each bus stopped at (needed in order to know when to go to the gas station).
3. Added counters for the number of stations each bus skipped (needed in order to know if an extra bus should be assigned to this line).
4. Added guarantees for each line, in order to send an extra bus when needed.



Delivered in Sprint 2
---------------------

1. Decreased the size of the problem in order to decrease the synthesization time.
2. Made the spectra realizable
3. Synthesized a controller for BusBossMain
4. Added guarantees
5. Added assumptions
