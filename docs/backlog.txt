- Init city in the run() method and move all the draw methods into the respective classes, so that each object will draw itself.
- Add roads between neighborhoods.
- Create the routes for the busses, and make the busses drive on them.
- Create the mall in the central neighborhood.
- Find pictures for the objects (bus, gas station, people, bus stations, mall…).
- Make the unused busses visible in the central station + initialize all busses in the central station.
- In each step each bus should update if it is at some station.
- Optional: For the general lines, all people must leave the bus at the last station.
- Optional: if the bus should go to the gas station, the next coordinate will be determined by the route from the current coordinate to the gas station.
- The realizability check takes more than an hour to finish running, and we could not figure out what causes this yet.
